An array is an object that holds multiple values

int[] array = new int[];

An array list is a type of array that will hold a list of objects

public ArrayList<Item> stuff = new ArrayList();

An array is an object that holds many values, but an arraylist holds 
many objects with certain values.

We could create an int, and take away from the int every time it gets hit.
