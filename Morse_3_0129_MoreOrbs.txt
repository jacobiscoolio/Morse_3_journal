A class constructor are variables that are used for the class called at the
begining of the class.

Size, position, and speed should be class constructors because these determine
how the orbs work.

doDamage, getShoot, and getIntersection because these will allow the orbs 
to do damge, be shot from the player, and intersect with the player.
