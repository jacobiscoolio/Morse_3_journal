I created a basic slick game that involves getting a powerup and getting
through a multitude of enemies to get the treasure.

I solved the problem that my map would crash my game. I solved this by
using a different map.

I thought my map was finished, but I never tested it, so when I came back,
I had to start over.

I was not able to meet the timeline because I did not have my map finished
by the first day.
