I created a game in which you try to get the treasure, while avoiding the enemies. I completed the challenge of finally getting my map to work. I did finish the map, but then it
turned out it didn't work, so I had to make a new on. This happened every time I made a new map, so I basically had to use the old map, and just change it a little. That is mainly
why I didn't finish.
