1. We used the elf64 to make the code executable by the 64 bit os
2. ld loads the shared libraries that we need to run the code
3. We don't need chmod because we created the files, so we already have
permission to execute it.
4.

global _start

        section .text
_start:
        ; write(1, message, 13)
        mov     rax, 1
        mov     rdi, 1
        mov     rsi, message
        mov     rdx, 15
        syscall

        ; exit(0)
        mov     eax, 60
        xor     rdi, rdi
        syscall
message:
        db      "Jacob Morse", 10

5. All I did was replace the was this easy with my name, then did the
given commands again.

6. Assembly is not easy, because it requires a lot of code to do very 
little. It is low level because it is very primitive and requires a lot
to work.
