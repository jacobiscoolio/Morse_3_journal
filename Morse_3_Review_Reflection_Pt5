I did know what a 2d array was, becuase I remebered that the map that we created used a 2d array to track the different properties.


1. What is an array?
2. What is the main difference between an array and an arraylist?
3. How do you make a 2d Array
4. How do you create an array?
5. Provide an example of iterating through an array with a for loop
6. How do you create an instance of another class?
7. Create a class with variables, a class constructor, and getters and setters.
