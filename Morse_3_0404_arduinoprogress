We have planned out our project, and allocated all the needed parts for the
project.

We need to figure out how to program the arduino to playsound and flash 
lights at the same time.

Hopefully an arduino playing one song and flashing lights according to the note

We are combing the music code and the light code

So far, we have written no functions.
